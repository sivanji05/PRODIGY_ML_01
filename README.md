House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project aims to predict house prices using a simple linear regression model. Linear regression is a basic yet powerful statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). In this project, we leverage linear regression to predict house prices based on various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains information about various houses including features like:

Size (in square feet)
Number of bedrooms
Location (latitude and longitude)
Age of the house
Distance from city center
etc.
The dataset has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values and outliers.

Requirements
To run this project locally, you need the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
You can install these dependencies using pip:


pip install numpy pandas matplotlib 
Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sivanji05/house-price-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd house_price
Run the main script:

Copy code
python house_price.py
This will train the linear regression model on the dataset and output predictions for house prices.

Results
After training the model, you can evaluate its performance using metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, etc. Additionally, you can visualize the predicted house prices compared to the actual prices to understand the model's accuracy.
